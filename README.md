# CHATBOT
Welcome to the ChatBot Project repository. This project contains a simple web-based chatbot interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a backend powered by Python and Flask. The chatbot reads and processes text from PDF and DOCX files and answers user queries using OpenAI's language model.
